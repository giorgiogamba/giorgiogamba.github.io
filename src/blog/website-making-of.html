            Hello!
      
            This is my first blog page ever. I admit I feel a bit excited and also a bit strange thinking about the fact I am starting a blog.
            
            Well... that's the plan, but how knows what would happen in the future.
            
            Why I decide to start this ambituous project? Simply: I love Computer Science and I would like to build a career as much as deep inside it.
            And what's the best way to keep me as much focused and updated as possible and showcase all the projects I am working on? A blog!
            
            Since when I was a child my father used to give me its old job computers. I loved to open them to see those strange hardwares knowing anything about them,
            or just trying to install some videogame found inside cereals or downloaded from the internet. Almost no one was working, or a virus was installed instead (sorry dad).
            During those days I used to browse the Internet and visit those strange and ugly websites where people was sharing solutions to the problems I was facing using my computer.
            Those blogs and forums where part of that wild-west Internet of the early 2000s and one of the most beautiful factors.
            
            Now, I want to start my own blog, where I would like to share my experience about a topic I am focusing on very deeply during these days: career development.
      
            Currently, I am working as a Game Programmer in Italy, a big city in the north of Italy near the place where I was born.
            I know, this is the workplace many people used to dream to achieve one day and they always remain amazed when I confess I am a programmer of that kind.
      
            I am passionate about video games since when I was a child (PS2 + Kingdom Hearts = Big Heart), but I also love the Computer Science in its entireness 
            and I am especially trying to cultivate as much as I can my energy to create a background for my career that could take me in higher places.
      
            There a lot of pieces to connect in order to achieve this: study (a lot), build network, market yourself, create side projects...
      
            But... from what I read, the first one is to build a portfolio.
      
            This blog will talk about my experience during my career develpment and how I approached every step in order to get the best, and the first step is to build a portfolio!
            I will be what I honestly wanted to have some year ago, reading the suggestions from someone else about the steps to do in order to not waste time.
